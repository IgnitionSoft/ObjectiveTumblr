						<p>This is version 0.85 of MKNetworkKit. Read the <a href="[http://mk.sg/8w](http://mk.sg/8w)"> blog post</a> for more. The master branch is a live working branch. Expect bugs!(?).</p>

<p>If you are too chicken, you can always pickup the latest stable code at the tag <a href="[https://github.com/MugunthKumar/MKNetworkKit/zipball/v0.83](https://github.com/MugunthKumar/MKNetworkKit/zipball/v0.83)"> v0.83 </a></p>

<p>The latest stable code is still not fully testing on Mac, though iOS is complete. Caching responses and invalidation of cache is not implemented the right way for the Mac target. MKNetworkKit is ready for production use on iOS apps.</p>

<p>MKNetworkKit can also be compiled to a static library and included. I will be updating the documentation on how to do this soon.</p>

<h3>Why MKNetworkKit?</h3>

<p>MKNetworkKit is inspired by the other two popular network frameworks ASIHTTPRequest and AFNetworking.
Mostly ASI, to some extent, AFNetworking. I&rsquo;ve been an unofficial &ldquo;evangelist&rdquo; of ASIHTTPRequest till the plug was pulled.</p>

<p>Marrying the feature set from both, MKNetworkKit throws in a bunch of new features like</p>

<ul>
<li>Single queue for the whole app</li>
<li>Auto queue sizing</li>
<li>Auto caching and restoring</li>
<li>Performs exactly one operation for similar requests</li>
<li>Background completion</li>
<li>Full ARC support</li>
<li>cURL-able debug lines.</li>
</ul>


<p>MKNetworkKit&rsquo;s goal was to make it as feature rich as ASIHTTPRequest yet simple and elegant to use like AFNetworking</p>
